Project Title: Simple Java To-Do List App

Description: This is a basic to-do list application built using Java Swing. It allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove completed tasks. and save you completed task to a txt file 

OOP Principles Employed:

Encapsulation: The Task class encapsulates data (task name, completion state) and behavior (changing state, getting buttons).
Inheritance: this app applies inheritance in various points like the child classes inside the app frame class inheriting characteristics from the parent class
Polymorphism:  (This application doesn't use polymorphism)
Abstraction: The List class provides an abstract view of the task list, handling component management and updates.
How to Use:

Compile: 
You'll need Java and an IDE (or a text editor and compiler) to compile the code. Refer to your development environment's documentation for specific instructions.
Run: Once compiled, execute the ToDoList class (the main class) to launch the application.
